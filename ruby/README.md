Gilded Rose Kata in Ruby

##Approach
- Go through requirements and write a test for each one
- Start with minor refactoring for the main lib file
- Start extracting methods based on smaller if conditionals
- Minor refactoring on lib file
- Extracted methods for:
  - reducing sell_in days for every item apart from 'Sulfuras'
  - updating properties for 'Aged Brie' 

##To look at
- Refactor methods according to what type of item it is
- Look at ```next``` keyword to skip lines of code
